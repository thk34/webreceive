A python script I created to send files from my phone or my 2nd computer to my main computer (here, the server). If you setup port forwarding (default port is 8081) you will be able to access it from other places.

## Setup
pip install flask

CHANGE THE IP AT THE END OF MAIN.PY TO THE LOCAL IP OF THE MACHINE THAT HOSTS THE SERVER

feel free to change the port (originally 8081) to another one if you want

python main.py

press enter


ctrl + C when done
